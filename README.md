# Prophet Utilities #
A (simple) java code to retrieve useful information about DSI Prophet '08 and REV2 sysex patches. Currently outputs the name and patch number of a sysex file (the first patch if a complete bank is loaded), so that you don't accidentally overwrite an existing patch when loading sysex files.
# Usage #
 java -jar prophetutils.jar <path/to/your/sysexfile>
